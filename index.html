			<h1>About</h1>
			<hr>
			<selection>
				<p> I am an embedded firmware engineer working at a stealth mode health care startup at Silicon Valley. I have over a decade
					of experience working on mission critical embedded systems from automotive system, networking time and synchronization,
					consumer electronic and medical device. </p>

				<p> I have significant experience working with ARM M0, M3 and M4 microcontrollers from wide verity of venders including NXP,
					Freescale, Atmel, ST Micro, TI and Microchip. </p>

				<p> For the last several years I have been working on ARM A9/A15 SoC from Xilinx and Altera. I have single handedly build
					the board support package, port bootloader (u-boot), port and configure Linux kernel, write device drivers and applications
					for wide variety of products.
				</p>

				<p>I have worked on may proprietary boards during my career which i am not in liberity to publish, however here are some
					of the open source sample projects i can share with you </p>
