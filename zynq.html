				<h1> <a id="xilinx">Xilinx Zynq 7000 (ZedBoard)</a> </h1><br>
				<p>
					Xilinx's all programmable SoCs are processor-centric platforms that offer software, hardware and I/O programmability in a
					single chip. The Zynq-7000 family is based on the All Programmable SoC architecture. Zynq-7000 products incorporate
					a dual core ARM Cortex-A9 based Processing System (PS) and Xilinx Programmable Logic (PL) in a single device.

				</p>

				<p>
					ZedBoard is a complete development kit for designers interested in exploring designs using the Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable
					SoC. . This section describes a group of projects which help to jumpstart the development process. The project include
					bare metal implementation with FreeRTOS , Linux Root File System (RFS), Linux Software Development Kit (LSDK) and a
					final project with both FreeRTOS and Linux running side by side on the same machine
				</p>


				<h2> <a href="https://github.com/sandeshghimire/FreeRTOSZedBoard"> FreeRTOS Port for ZedBoard </a></h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					FreeRTOS is an industry standard open source real time operating system. It is popular and runs in wide variety of microcontrollers
					from Cortex M0/M3/M4 through A7/A9 SoC. FreeRTOS is versatile and if you are looking for a real time performance from
					your Zynq-7000 SoC it is the right solution. </p>

				<p>In this example i have created 3 threads and a software timer, the tx task, rx task and a dma task. These task have unique
					priority and defined stack sizes. In addition there is a software timer which fires periodically at 10 Hz.

				<h2> <a href="https://github.com/sandeshghimire/Zed-Board-Root-File-System"> ZedBoard SD Card Image  </a></h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The SD card image contains all the essential components to boot the linux operating system. The image has two partition,
					the first partition has two paration, the first one is FA32 paration which contains the First Stage Bootloader (FSBL).
					The bootloader (U-BOOT). The device tree (TD) and Linux Kernel .
				</p>
				<p>
					The second partition of the SD card contains the Root File System (RFS) based on linux standard base (LSB). The RFS contains
					all the essentials file and library to boot the ZedBoard. This RFS is developed from scratch for the ZedBoard therefore
					it is not part of any distribution but ZedBoard and every component has been configured and optimized for ZedBoard.

				<h2> <a href="https://github.com/sandeshghimire/Zed-Board-Software-Development-Kit"> Zed Board Software Development Kit (Linux) </a></h2>
				<hr>
				<p>A software development kit (SDK) is typically a set of software development tools that allows the creation of applications
					for a certain software package, software framework, hardware platform, operating system, or similar development platform.The
					installation process for ZSDK is available on the readme file here. <a href="https://github.com/sandeshghimire/FreeRTOSZedBoard/releases"> here  </a>					</p>


				<h2> <a href="https://github.com/sandeshghimire/ZedBoard-Sample-Source-Code"> Zed Board Sample Source Code </a></h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In order to develop application on embedded linux you need three components, the sd card or emmc image. The software
					development kit and getting started guide. The earlier two are explained above. The later is available here.

				</p>
				<p>
					There are three sample projects, the first one is sample code written in C, it creates 10 threads prints message and exits.
					This example uses POSIX pthread library . The second is sample code written in C++, it uses cpp std::thread. Both of
					these two example are based on CMake build system. </p>

				<p>The third example is linux driver project. First the script configures environment for driver development and it uses
					makefile to build the drivers.

				<h2> <a href="https://github.com/sandeshghimire/-AMP-Running-Linux-and-Bare-Metal-System-on-Both-Zynq-SoC-Processors">  AMP Running Linux and Bare-Metal System on Both Zynq SoC Processors </a></h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					This is a interesting project i have been working on for a while. This project take best of both world, the bare metal real
					time performance of FreeRTOS and embedded Linux. They share data via shared memory model. The work in progress, you
					can keep track of this project here.
