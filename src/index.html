            <h3 id="caffe">About</h3>
            The soccentric engineering group has completed many successful collaborations with a wide array of
            companies, ranging from early startups to fortune 500 firms. The team has accumulated decades of
            experience
            developing mission critical applications using
            Altera and Xilinx SoC platforms. The overall engineering goal has focused on leveraging the accumulated
            knowledge and expertise from past projects to help current clients solve their application challenges.
            Our
            group’s expertise is focused
            on determining design bottlenecks, providing optimal solutions, and helping transform applications from
            concept to a marketable solution. Our highly motivated team of engineers is dedicated to working in any
            environment from small startups
            to established industrial leaders.

            <p><strong>Expressive architecture</strong> encourages application and innovation. Models and
                optimization
                are defined by configuration without hard-coding. Switch between CPU and GPU by setting a single

                can

                inference and 4 ms/image for learning
                and more recent library versions and hardware are faster still. We believe that Caffe is among the
                fastest convnet implementations available.</p>
